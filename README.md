## Adding Native Code

This project can be run from a web browser or the Expo client app. You may find that you want to add more native code later on. You can do this by ejecting the project and rebuilding it yourself.

- Run `yarn eject` to create the native projects.
- You can still run your project in the web browser or Expo client, you just won't be able to access any new native modules you add.
